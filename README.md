About
=============================

A [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets) landing page for an application.

It displays a most-recently-used file list on the right side (up to 9 files) and a list of
customizable buttons on the left.

- Users clicking on these buttons can be handled via a `wxEVT_STARTPAGE_CLICKED` event.
- Modified dates are shown next to each file in the MRU list.
  These dates are shown in a human readable format (e.g., "Just now", "12 minutes ago",
  "Yesterday", "Tues at 1:07 PM").
- Human readable file paths are shown below the files (e.g., "Documents Â» Invoices")
- Includes a "Clear file list" button beneath the MRU list.
- The application name & logo can be shown above the custom buttons.
- A dynamic greeting (based on the time of day) is shown above the MRU list.
  This greeting is also customizable (e.g., can optionally include the user's name).
- Customizable theming.
- Supports dark mode.
- Supports HiDPI displays.
